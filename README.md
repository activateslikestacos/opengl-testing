# OpenGL Testing

### Description

This repository is just for holding my various tests and projects with OpenGL and GLFW. Most of the code on here is developed following a guide on learnopengl.com. If you have a decent knowledge of C/C++ programming and want to learn OpenGL, then I would recommend you visit that website.

The code you will see in this repo isn't exactly like the tutorial since I added a good bit of notes and used some functions that I made to make things a bit easier to read.

### Purpose

OpenGL is a very powerful and useful programming language for working with GPUs to display awesome stuff! When trying to develop using higher-level libraries, we found that they were slower and less capable than straight OpenGL, so we decided to start learning it.
